# Reebs Backend Documentation

## Overview
The backend is a set of Netlify Serverless Functions written in Node.js. Data is stored in PostgreSQL (Railway). Prisma is used for schema and migrations, but the functions primarily use `pg` directly.

Key responsibilities:
- Auth (staff login + manager PIN)
- Inventory, orders, and bookings
- Stock movements + maintenance logs
- Accounting, expenses, invoicing
- Delivery planning and HR records
- Marketing discounts

## Runtime and Data Access
- Functions live in `netlify/functions/*.js`.
- Production base URL: `https://portal.reebspartythemes.com/.netlify/functions/*`.
- Each function creates a `pg` Client with `DATABASE_URL` and `ssl: { rejectUnauthorized: false }`.
- `prisma/schema.prisma` is the source of truth for table definitions.
- `prismaClient.js` configures Prisma with the Postgres adapter (used by scripts).

## Authentication
### Staff Login
- Endpoint: `POST /.netlify/functions/login`
- Validates user credentials from the `user` table.
- Passwords are hashed with `utils/passwords.js` (scrypt).
- Returns a signed token with `USER_APP_SECRET`.

### Manager Login (Mobile App)
- Endpoint: `POST /.netlify/functions/managerLogin`
- Expects 6-digit PIN, checked against `MANAGER_PIN_HASH`.
- Returns manager token signed with `MANAGER_APP_SECRET`.

### Token Handling
- Staff token is validated by `requireUser()` in `netlify/functions/_shared/userAuth.js`.
- Manager token is validated by `getManagerFromEvent()` in `netlify/functions/_shared/managerAuth.js`.
- Frontend attaches the token as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` for Netlify function calls.

## Organization Scoping
- `netlify/functions/_shared/organization.js` resolves `organizationId` from:
  - `x-organization-id` header
  - `organizationId` in query/body
  - fallback to user organization
- Frontend `patchOrganizationFetch()` automatically attaches org ID + auth token.

## Money Handling
- All money is stored in integer cents in the DB.
- Functions convert to and from cents when needed.

## Data Model Summary
Main tables from `prisma/schema.prisma`:
- Organization: multi-tenant root entity
- User: staff accounts with roles and permissions
- EmployeeProfile: HR details per user
- Customer: buyer or booking client
- Product: unified catalog for retail and rentals
- Order + OrderItem: retail sales
- Booking + BookingItem: rental reservations
- StockMovement: stock in/out audit log
- Expense: operational expenses
- Discount: marketing codes
- Vendor: suppliers
- MaintenanceLog: asset maintenance history
- Document: stored documents and invoices (base64 data)
- Timesheet: employee clock-in/out
- Delivery: booking delivery status + route metadata
- BouncyCastle, IndoorGame, Machine, ShopItem: specialized catalog metadata
- ManagerDevice: Expo push tokens for manager app

## API Reference
Below is a concise map of each Netlify function.

## Request/Response Examples
Headers used in most staff-auth endpoints:

## Environment Variables (Backend)
Core:
- `DATABASE_URL`
- `USER_APP_SECRET`
- `MANAGER_APP_SECRET`
- `MANAGER_PIN_HASH`

Optional integrations:
- `WHATSAPP_ACCESS_TOKEN`
- `WHATSAPP_PHONE_NUMBER_ID`
- `WHATSAPP_MANAGER_PHONE`
- `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` (or `GOOGLE_GEOCODING_API_KEY`)

## Deployment and Ops
Netlify (frontend + functions):
- Deploys `src/` (Vite build) and `netlify/functions/*`.
- Recommended local command: `npm run netlify` to mirror Netlify routing in dev.
- Functions run with Node runtime and read `DATABASE_URL` + secrets from Netlify env.

Railway (PostgreSQL):
- Primary database host for `DATABASE_URL`.
- SSL required (`rejectUnauthorized: false` is used in functions).
- Prisma migrations live in `prisma/migrations/*` and can be applied via `npx prisma migrate`.

Data imports:
- One-off import scripts exist in the repo root (`importUsers.js`, `importProducts.js`, etc.).
- These scripts use the same `DATABASE_URL` to seed or transform data.
